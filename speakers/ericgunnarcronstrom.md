# How we made the switch: a case study on automating a complex report.

The Center for Charter Schools at Central Michigan University produces annual reports for about 60 schools. The reporting process used to be a cumbersome blend of many technologies. The Center used to use a blend of SQL, Excel, inDesign, and VBScript that would all culminate in a nice looking, branded report for each school. 2 years ago, staff turnover allowed the data team to rethink the process, having had experience in R from graduate work the team at the Center decided to go all in on R Studio and R Markdown for report production a mere 1 month before the reports were due to be published.
This talk will be a case study of how we as an organization adopted RStudio tools to streamline a cumbersome process to fantastic results.
