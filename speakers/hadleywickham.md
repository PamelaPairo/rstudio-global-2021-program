# Maintaining the house the tidyverse built

Hadley will talk about how the tidyverse has evolved since its creation (just five years ago!). You'll learn about our greatest successes, learn from our biggest failures, and get some hints of what's coming down the pipeline for the future.

# Speaker bio

Hadley Wickham is Chief Scientist at RStudio. He's interested in building tools (computational and cognitive) that make data ingest, preparation, manipulation, visualization and analysis easier. He's developed over 30 R packages, for data analysis (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr), making frustrating parts of R easier to use (lubridate for dates, stringr for strings, httr for accessing web APIs), and for streamlining the R package development (devtools, roxygen2, and testthat).
