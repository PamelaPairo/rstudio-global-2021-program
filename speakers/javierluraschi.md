# Using pins with Python and JavaScript

Last year, [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com) got released as a brand new R package to pin, discover and cache remote resources for R users. This package has matured to support many use cases; from caching remote URLs, and easily sharing datasets with other R users, to building automated pipelines.

However, in order to truly collaborate in multi-disciplinary data-driven teams, one needs to consider how to collaborate beyond R? How can we share resources with designers and machine learning experts who happen to use different programming languages like Python and JavaScript?

This talk will introduce the [pinsjs](https://pinsjs.github.io/) project, a cross-language community project which has the goal of bringing `pins` to the broader open source community to enable rich workflows across larger data-driven teams.
