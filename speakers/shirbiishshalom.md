# Using R to Up Your Experimentation Game

Have you ever cut an A/B test short? Maybe because of traffic constraints, your antsy boss, or early successful results. In reality, cutting your test short can be catastrophic, making your business decision no better than a coin flip.  Learn some R-driven tips & tricks to get meaningful results quickly with a statistically rigorous methodology called sequential testing, an A/B testing enhancement my team employs at Intuit.

Key Takeaways.
1. What is sequential testing and how to use it.
2. How to learn (and fail!) quickly by taking big metric swings
3. How I used R to share my learnings & make them useful for anyone (even non-data scientists!) at my company.
