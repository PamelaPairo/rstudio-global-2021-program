# On programming, teaching, and building interactive tutorials with learnr::

Teaching R is part of my activities as a community organizer, an RStudio Certified Instructor, a conference chair, and a researcher. Since 2019, I use the learnr package to generate interactive tutorials to teach R synchronously and asynchronously. The addition of the Tutorials panel in RStudio IDE and the need for virtual classes made the use of this package even more interesting. In this talk, I will tell you how to generate interactive tutorials, how to add pedagogical tools to them, what other packages you can use with {learnr} and show multilingual examples.
