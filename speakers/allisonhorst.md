# Art Lessons: One Year as RStudio’s Artist-in-Residence

Art can be a welcoming bridge for learners and users to engage with and learn tools and skills in R. As RStudio’s first Artist-in-Residence, my goal has been to make the R landscape more welcoming for a broader community of users through engaging, didactic artwork. In this R, art, and heart-filled talk, I’ll share the motivation behind my R artwork and some lessons learned over the past year as Artist-in-Residence, including: 

- Learning to embrace cute *and* credible artwork
- Art to help students engage with, learn and remember R skills
- Art for community building and support

I hope this talk inspires viewers to use, create and share more artwork, so that together we can make the R landscape feel even brighter.
