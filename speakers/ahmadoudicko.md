# Humanitarian Data Science with R

Humanitarian actors are increasingly using data to drive their decisions. Since the Haiti 2010 earthquake, the volume of data collected and used by humanitarians has been growing exponentially and organizations are now relying on data specialists to turn all this data into life-saving data products.

These data products are created by teams using proprietary point and click software. The process from the raw data to the final data product involves a lot of clicking, copying and pasting and is usually not reproducible.

Another approach to humanitarian data science is possible using `R`. In this talk, I will show how to seamlessly develop reproducible, reusable humanitarian data products using the `tidyverse`, `rmarkdown` and some domain-focused `R` packages.
