# Making the jump from learning to applying: R training and documentation for different levels of expertise

How does someone make the leap from learning R to actively applying R in professional work? 
At what point (if ever!) do we get to call ourselves "experts" in R?
This talk explores what differentiates novice, practitioner, and expert R programmers,
and how transitions
between these stages occur.
I'll discuss the type of support required for R users to move from one level of expertise to the next,
and how different types of training and documentation can support R users at each level.
Understanding variable levels of education among R practitioners supports our own professional work,
from collaborative coding to package development,
and helps build a bigger, more inclusive R community.

# Speaker bio

Kate Hertweck is a scientist and educator
who endeavors to uphold core values like:
diversity/equity/inclusion, 
accessibility of information, and
learning over knowing.
Kateâ€™s graduate training at University of Missouri focused on genomic evolution of plants,
and was followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent, Duke University)
where they began working exclusively in computational biology.
Kate then spent four years as an assistant professor teaching 
bioinformatics, genomics, plant taxonomy,
and scientific communication.
Kate is currently bioinformatics training manager at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
where they lead and implement training and community building to support the data-intensive biomedical research community.
Kate is an instructor and trainer for The Carpentries (serving as a leader in community governance from 2016-2019),
and is an advisor for Metadocencia.
These non-profit groups support best practices in teaching
for data/computational skills and Spanish-speaking educators, respectively.
Kate likes to spend their time enjoying all things science fiction
and knitting sweaters from handspun yarn for their tiny, grumpy, elderly rescue dog, Loki.
Kate uses perceived pronouns,
so any pronoun you think fits also works for them.
